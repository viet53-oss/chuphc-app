# CHU CORE - COMPREHENSIVE REDESIGN & MENU PLAN

## 1. MENU STRUCTURE (The "Guided Workflow" System)
The navigation is split into a **Bottom Tab Bar** (Primary Actions) and a **Side Drawer** (Utility/Account).

### Primary Bottom Navigation
- **DASHBOARD (Home)**: Overall status, weekly score, and quick-glance pillar tiles.
- **CHECK-IN (Central FAB)**: The core "Secret Sauce". A quick guided workflow for the day's compliance.
- **MY LOGS**: Summary of history (Food, Sleep, Activity).
- **LEARN**: Education center (Staff-managed PDFs and videos).
- **AWARDS**: Motivational points, badges, and streaks.

### Utility Navigation (Side Drawer)
- Profile & Bio
- My Smart Goals
- Staff Messaging
- Settings (Notifcations, Privacy)
- Admin Portal (Staff access only)
- Sign Out
